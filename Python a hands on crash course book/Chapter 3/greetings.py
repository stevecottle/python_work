#3-2 Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1 (names.py), but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
#The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

cottle_names=["steve", "vicky", "rudy", "marnie", "flynn"]
print(f"Hi there {cottle_names[3].title()}, how are you?")
print(f"Hi there {cottle_names[2].upper()}, you're great!")
print(f"Hey, {cottle_names[1]}, watcha doin?")
